              Actually i faced lots of problems while i was working on this
              project. But I can not disclose as this is not my personal project
              but eventually i solved all the issues which i was facing. and
              that was so proud moment for me but i continued to getting errors
              and frustrating comlications in coding but i had never given up
              and ultimately i was always able to came up with some work around
              for that particular problem.

              Lots of, to tell in short I learnt how to optimise my code, and
              make all functionalities efficient. One of my favourite thing i
              learnt is to make re usable components which we can use on
              multiple places with different parameters.
